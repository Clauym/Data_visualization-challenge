Comments:

Pymaceuticals_ver1.jpynb is the first uploaded version of the code. I am trying to figure out how to get the outliers so to display the values and numbers. If that is the version I turned in and I finally discover how to display the outliers I would love to be able to resubmit my solutiion later.
